# Basic_Programming_Assignment_2

## Overview

This is a **console-based To-Do List application** created using Python. The program allows users to manage tasks through a simple menu system.

## Features

* Add tasks with a priority (High, Medium, Low)
* View all tasks with status (Pending / Done)
* Mark tasks as completed
* Handles invalid inputs
* Runs continuously until the user exits

## How It Works

Tasks are stored in a Python list. Each task includes:

* Description
* Priority
* Status (Done or Pending)

The menu repeats using a loop and responds based on user input.

## File

* **Todo.py** – Contains the full program code
